# GenM3

- version: `v0.1.0`
- author: [Will-YiFei Sheng](syf20020816@outlook.com)

## How to use

gen_ui M3 component based on the makepad `main` branch, but with some additional additions, so you'll need to use the repository address I provided.

```toml
[dependencies]
makepad-widgets = { git = "https://github.com/syf20020816/makepad.git", branch = "genui"}
gen_ui = {path="../gen_ui"}
```
